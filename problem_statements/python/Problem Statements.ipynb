    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "Create a Python program that generates and displays the multiplication table for a given number.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**  \n",
    "Understanding multiplication tables is fundamental in mathematics. In this task, you will build a program that takes a number as input and generates its multiplication table up to a specified range. This will help reinforce the concepts of loops and iteration in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Input:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   The program should prompt the user to enter a number for which they want the multiplication table.\n",
    "    -   The program should also ask for the range up to which the table should be generated (e.g., up to 10, 12, etc.).\n",
    "2.  **Process:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   Use a loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to the specified range.\n",
    "    -   For each iteration, multiply the given number by the current loop index and store/display the result.\n",
    "3.  **Output:**\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "**Background:**  \n",
    "Guessing games are a fun way to learn how to handle loops, conditionals, and user input in programming. In this task, you will build a simple game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it within a certain number of attempts.\n",

    "2.  **Process:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   The program should compare the user's guess to the randomly selected number.\n",
    "    -   If the guess is too high, the program should inform the user that their guess was too high.\n",
    "    -   If the guess is too low, the program should inform the user that their guess was too low.\n",
    "    -   The user should be given a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the correct number.\n",
    "3.  **Output:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   If the user guesses correctly, the program should congratulate them and display the number of attempts taken.\n",
    "    -   If the user fails to guess the number within 10 attempts, the program should reveal the correct number and end the game.\n",
