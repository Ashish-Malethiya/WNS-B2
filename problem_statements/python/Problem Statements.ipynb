    "Problem Statement **1**: **Simple Budget Tracker**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "Create a Python program that helps users track their daily expenses and calculate their remaining budget for the month.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**  \n",
    "Managing personal finances is essential, and one of the first steps in doing so is keeping track of daily expenses. As a beginner in Python, you will create a simple application that allows users to input their daily expenses and view their remaining budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Input:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   The program should start by asking the user for their total budget for the month.\n",
    "    -   Each day, the user can input their daily expenses in various categories (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment).\n",
    "2.  **Process:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   The program should keep a running total of the expenses.\n",
    "    -   After each input, the program should update the total expenses and subtract it from the monthly budget to show the remaining budget.\n",
    "3.  **Output:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   Display the total amount spent so far.\n",
    "    -   Display the remaining budget.\n",
    "    -   If the user tries to spend more than their remaining budget, the program should display a warning message.\n",
    "4.  **Bonus Features:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   Allow users to categorize their expenses and display a breakdown of expenses by category.\n",
    "    -   Add the ability for the user to reset their budget and start over."

    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "Create a Python program that calculates and assigns a letter grade based on a student's numerical score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**  \n",
    "Grading systems are often used to evaluate students' performance. In this task, you will build a simple program that takes a numerical score as input and assigns the corresponding letter grade according to a predefined scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",

    "1.  **Input:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   The program should prompt the user to enter a student's score as a percentage (e.g., 85.5).\n",
    "2.  **Process:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   The program should determine the letter grade based on the following grading scale:\n",
    "        -   **A**: 90% and above\n",
    "        -   **B**: 80% to 89.99%\n",

    "        -   **D**: 60% to 69.99%\n",
    "        -   **F**: Below 60%\n",
    "3.  **Output:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   The program should display the student's letter grade.\n",
    "4.  **Bonus Features:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   Allow the user to input multiple scores and calculate the average grade.\n",
    "    -   Display a message encouraging the student to improve if the grade is below a certain threshold (e.g., below a C)\n"
